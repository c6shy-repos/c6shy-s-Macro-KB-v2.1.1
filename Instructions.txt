						 	{How to save custom scripts}

1: Make your script
2: Ctrl+Shift+S to save as(only do this once, every other time you save only do Ctrl+S)
3: the dropdown bar underneath where it says files name, MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT ALL FILES. If you don't it will not save as a AHK file.
4: Name it whatever you want as long as there is an .ahk at the end.(if the file type is not selected as: all, then it will show up as .ahk.txt which is what we don't want.
5: If done correctly it should show a giant H on the file icon.
5: double click the file, and in the background it will run. (it will not open up AutoHotKey fully so you will not see it in taskbar)
